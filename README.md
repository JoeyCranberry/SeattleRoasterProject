# SeattleRoasterProject

A Blazor project that allows users to find coffee beans by searching through the catalogs of local Seattle roasteries and filtering by not only the beans (roast level, country of origin, etc.) but also roastery social causes like woman-owned roasteries, Fair Trade certification, or sourcing transparency.  

Written in C#, JS, with HTML, Css and Bootstrap 5.2, with a back-end on MongoDb
